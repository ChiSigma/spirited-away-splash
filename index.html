                <p>Another year, another boat. We are excited to announce our annual Chi Sigma boat cruise. For all you constitutional scholars out there, we will be honoring the 21st Amendment. Take to the seas with us to celebrate <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/new-beers-eve/">New Beer's Eve</a>. Upon signing the legislation to end prohibition, it is reported Roosevelt stated ‚ÄúMan, I really hope people throw some rad boat parties.‚Äù Join us in making his dream a reality.

                <h1 id="FAQ" style="margin-top: 150px">FAQ</h1>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">What's different from last year?</h4>
                <p>Last year was our first time putting on this event, and we learned a lot while managing 275+ ticket sales. 
                <br><strong>1)</strong> We have a promotion that will allow you to get a free or discounted ticket!
                <br><strong>2)</strong> We're working closely with the Spirit of Boston team to make sure boarding the boat is an easier process. 
                <br><strong>3)</strong> We pray everyday to our different gods and deities that the weather will be better <span style="font-size: 12px">*knock on wood*.</span> 
                <br><strong>n)</strong> If you have any suggestions that you think we missed, please let us know! We're open to anything that will make this evening a better one for you and all of our guests.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Are you still selling tickets?</h4>
                <p>Yes, and we will continue to do so until we sell out or set sail - whichever comes first.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Do I have to be 21+ to attend?</h4>
                <p>Nope! We've just been keeping track of people's ages so that we can give the Spirit of Boston a heads up on how much booze
                to stock the paid bars with.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Are you guys making a profit from this?</h4>
                <p>When we came up with the idea to organize this event, our goal was to make it a good time for everyone.
                Since cheaper is almost always better, we decided to sell the tickets at cost. We'd rather have a fun time than make a profit</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">What's the deal with the open bar event?</h4>
                <p>We were approached by another organization, and they were interested in partnering with us for an event on March 15th.
                Our arrangement is that we will bring the people, and they will provide the beverages. Location and additional details will be
                revealed at a later date.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">What if I can go to the open bar but not the boat party?</h4>
                <p>If that's the case, refer someone to the boat party and you will both be eligible to attend the open bar.
                There is a space on the sign-up form for someone to include the email of the person that referred them.
                As soon as they pay for their cruise ticket, you (the referrer) will be eligible to attend the open bar as well.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Is this for Northeastern students only?</h4>
                <p>We are planning this event to try to get as many groups of people together as possible. Everyone is welcome.
                Last year, we had students attending from 7 states and 26 different schools.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Is this actually happening?</h4>
                <p>Yep. We signed a contract, so this boat will be setting sail with or without you - we hope you choose the prior.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Do I have to pay for my ticket right away?</h4>
                <p>Of course not. We're all college kids and get that you might not be able to pay right away. Feel free to sign-up
                and pay when you're good and ready.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">What if I don't know what I'm doing that day?</h4>
                <p>That's okay! Go ahead and sign-up anyway. There are no strings attached to filling out the form.
                That way, we can get an idea of how many people are interested, and it makes planning on our end easier.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Is this the same boat as some of the other aquatic events?</h4>
                <p>Nope - at least not the larger events. The Spirit of Boston is newly renovated and designed specifically for
                this kind of event. We have a few links on this site and the Facebook page with info on the venue if you want to know more.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">After I've paid, can I return my ticket?</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately, we have to have a minimum number of people sign up for the event, so we cannot accept
                    refunds. If for some reason this event has to be cancelled, you will be reimbursed for your ticket.
                    If you resell your ticket, please notify us at <a href="mailto:info@chisigma.co" class="link">info@chisigma.co</a>
                    so we can update the new ticket information on our end.

                        Free. A college student‚Äôs favorite word. ‚ÄúI got a free Chi Sigma Cruise ticket‚Äù is probably their favorite sentence.
                        <br>
                        Thanks to our wonderful friends at Stoke, with only a few minutes of effort, you can earn a discounted ticket. For every person that you get to download Stoke, you get $5 off your Cruise ticket. Hit a max of 8 downloads and you just got yourself a free ticket!
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Steps to Your Discount</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        <br><strong>1)</strong> Sign-up <a style="color: red;" target="_blank" href="https://manifest.chisigma.co/passengerform">here</a> &amp; pay for your Cruise ticket
                        <br><strong>2)</strong> Download Stoke via <a style="color: red;" target="_blank" href="https://app.appsflyer.com/id1251971407?pid=boston&c=northeastern">https://app.appsflyer.com/id1251971407?pid=boston&amp;c=northeastern</a> and create a profile
                        <br><strong>3)</strong> Send a screenshot of your Stoke profile to <a href="mailto:info@chisigma.co" class="link">info@chisigma.co</a>
                        <br><strong>4)</strong> Boom! - that‚Äôs $5 off your ticket
                        <br><strong>5)</strong> Get 7 other people (it can be pretty much anyone) to do Step #2 and send you a screenshot of their profile
                        <br><strong>6)</strong> Forward that screenshot to us. Each verified download is another $5 off your ticket
                    </p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">After I email you a screenshot, when will I get my $5 back?</h4>
                    <p>Each of these emails needs to be manually processed, so rebates will be sent out in bulk at the end of each day.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Can multiple people use the same download towards their ticket?</h4>
                    <p>Unfortunately, no. The $5 is rewarded for each unique download, so reusing someone's screenshot doesn't count.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Do I have to get all 8 downloads?</h4>
                    <p> Nope! If you download the app yourself, we‚Äôll send you $5 after we process your screenshot. If your BFF or Mom downloads it, that‚Äôs another $5. You‚Äôll get a rebate for each screenshot you send us - not just if you send us all 8.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">I‚Äôve got an Android phone and Stoke is only for iPhones.</h4>
                    <p>If you‚Äôve got friends with an iPhone, send us a screenshot of their profile, and you‚Äôll get your $5.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Do my friends and I have to use the link that you provided?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! Please use <a style="color: red;" target="_blank" href="https://app.appsflyer.com/id1251971407?pid=boston&c=northeastern">https://app.appsflyer.com/id1251971407?pid=boston&amp;c=northeastern</a> otherwise Stoke can‚Äôt verify your downloads.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">What if I paid with Cash or Credit?</h4>
                    <p>We‚Äôll still getchu your money, but we‚Äôll have to work out something special for you. Shoot us an <a href="mailto:info@chisigma.co" class="link">email</a> or message <a style="color: red;" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/chisigma">Chi Sigma on Facebook</a> if you‚Äôre concerned about this, and we‚Äôll help you out.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">I‚Äôm a CS kid and I‚Äôm gonna write a bot to get me my downloads!</h4>
                    <p>If you figure out how to get all of that working that‚Äôs pretty cool, but please don‚Äôt do that. Pretty please with a cherry on top‚Ä¶ if Stoke flags a download as fraudulent, one of our 6 members has to pay that $5 out of their own pocket. We‚Äôre college kids too; $5 is like 2 Taco Bell quesadillas we could‚Äôve eaten. (but actually, if you do figure out a way to do that, send us the GitHub link. We‚Äôd love to see the code.)</p>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-top: 90px; padding-bottom: 40px;">Thanks for supporting us, hope to see you in April!</p>
